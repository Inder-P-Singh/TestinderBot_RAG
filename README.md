# TestinderBot_RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation Chat for Test Automation and Software Testing: Interactive RAG demo that answers questions about test automation and software testing using the published dataset: Testinder Software Testing &amp; Test Automation Posts (Kaggle).

Quick links
- Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inderpsingh/testinder-software-testing-and-test-automation-posts
- Notebook (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/code/inderpsingh/testinderbot-rag-p1/

Quickstart (local / Kaggle)
1. Clone the repo and open `TestinderBot_RAG_P1.ipynb`.  
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Important**: If you install faiss-cpu, restart the kernel / session before running the notebook (to avoid native plugin/CUDA registration warnings).

Run notebook cells from top â†’ bottom. Example query to try in the CLI cell:
How to write a Selenium test to click a button?

What it does
- Loads the published CSV of chunked blog posts.
- Embeds chunks with intfloat/e5-small-v2 and builds a FAISS IndexFlatL2.
- Retrieves top candidates for a user query; optional reranking via cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2.

Generates final answers using an instruction-tuned generator (FLAN-T5 / Mistral if available).
